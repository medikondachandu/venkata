                                                   SELENIUM


Software Testing:
there 2 types 
1)Manual  Tseting 
2)Automation Testing 
  ==================
     FUNCTIONAL TESTING                                                                                    NONFUNCTIONAL TESTING 
    --------------------                                                                                   ----------------------
   Functions (or features) are tested by feeding them input and examining the output.                   this testing concentrates on the non functional aspect of the application.

Funtional Testing Tools:  
=======================

>>>>  QTP/UFT
>>>>  Selenium 

SELENIUM TOOL:
--------------
What is difrerence between  Selenium And QTP
              Selenium                                                                                    QTP
              --------											-------
  >> Open source Tool, No licence Cost                                                   >> it is devloped by mercury company & it is taken over by the HP company
                                                                                             so vendor  HP , costly tool

 >> it support web based appilications only                                               >>it supports Desktop And Web Appilications

 >> it supports java, C#,PHP,RUBY ,Python 
    Perl... to create and enhance test cases                                             >> it suuports VB SCript and very compofrt with  VB Script
    it very comfort with Java

>> it supports unix, mac,Mac                                                              >> It supports only windows 

>> it Supports All browsers                                                             >>it supports only internet explorer, firefox, chrome

>> It is combinations of Diffrent tools like                                            >> it is single to so easy to use 
   Selenium WebDriver/RC/IDE/Grid
   that"s why it is diffucult to use 

>> No object Repository means no storage device                                        >> it has object repository 

                                          


                                                  SELENIUM INTRODUCTION
                                                 ========================

1)History of Selenium 

>Selenium 1st came to life in 2004
>selenium webdriver lanched in google in 2006
>in 2008 web driver merged with Selenium RC


2)Selenium License

>all selenium products are released by under the licnese of Apache 2.0
>anbody can down load and use 
>anybody can modify the source code 
>anybody can distribute the code 

Note: selling the modified  code is not allowed 


3)Selenium supporting platform/Envornment :
  
   a)Appailication  Envornment:

      >it is does support only GUI ased appilications
      >it is doesnot support CUI (Character USER Interface ) based aplication 
      >it is doesnot support  I-tier(stand alone),  II-tier(Desktop Applications)
      >it supports web based appilications 
      >which are having Web Forms then only it supports mobiel Appilcations 


    b) Operating evornment:
      > it supports windows, unix, mac
    
    c)web Browsers:
      > it supports all web Browsers like ie, opera ,chrome
    
    d) programming languages:
      > it supports  programming languages like java, php , c#, python , 






SELENIUM SUITE OF TOOLS:
========================

1)Selenium IDE(Integrated devlopment tool):
  > It Supports Firefox browser only 
  > It has recording and play back feature 
  > using recording feature it can generate test cases
     when ever you selecting the recording feature when we doing any operations it was generated by default   HTML  Feature 
 NOTE: with help of Selenium IDE we can use test case SCRIPT in HTML in another  Languages like java c python 
       it means expport test cases in to  another programming languages  
       MENAS COPY THE SCRIPT FROM   Selenium IDE paste any other tools like  Selenium webdriver/RC/GRID


dawbacks;  > it supports only firefox 
========   > it  doesnot support data driven test(we check the functionality agian and agin using multiple data ) and  
           > no flow control(not supports conditional statments and loop statements )
           > no detailed result


2)Selenium RC:
===============   it was the 1st automation tool
     FEATURES;
     > it is client server appilication 
     > it supports conditional and loop statements, supports all browsers
     > Import test cases from slenium IDE

    drwabacks;
      > it takes more time test excution 
     >it can' excute test cases in parllalel


SELENIUM WEBDRIVER:
====================
>> it is a programming interface 
>> it has programming interface it is allowa us create and excute test cases in 
   diffrent web browsers like firefox,chrome.ie etc
>> webdriver supports different programing languages(java,c,.net , php) to  enhance test cases 
>>it supports unix, mac,Mac  different os"s
>> web driver suports data driven test (check the functionality again and again  )
   it supports cross browser test 
 > Using TestNG we can generate  HTML test reports 

it provides only summary

Webdriver doesnot have built in result in reporting facility, with help of TestNG we can generate HTML test reports 


SELENIUM GRID;
--------------

 > it was used to grouping tests
